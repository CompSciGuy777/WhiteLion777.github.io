       <p>I grew up outside Washington D.C. and began my affinity for technology at an early age.  When I was 18 I moved to New Orleans for school and my parents and family moved to Tallahassee, FL.  I studied History at Tulane and graduated with my B.A. in 2007.</p>
       <p>After graduation, I moved to Tallahassee, FL and took Pre-med classes on what is the greatest misadventure of my life.  The health profession is for some, but not for me.  I left medical school and desided to serve my army contract.  I am now a Battalion Medical Officer stationed out of Fort Hood, TX.  I am thankful to have a good job in these times of ecomomic turmoil.  I enjoy working with and on computers and want to learn and do more.  I am hungry to learn all I can.  My next project is going to be an html5 game (maybe a series of them?).</p>
       <p>I am happily married with 2 great kids.(One isn't pictured , we need a new family photo.  She is still loved very much :)</p>
